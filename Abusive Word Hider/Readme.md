<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<div align="center">

So basically , After enabling this extension , it will hide abusive words from every heading and paragraphs . 
and also remember , 
  
<strong>  
Some abusive words are too bad and that's why I haven't add those in the code .  </strong>   
  
So, if you want to add all those jump to the " .js  " and add those which ever you like ( Jump to the bottom, there I have shown how you can add more words, which you want to hide).
