# Timer: A chrome extension

A timer chrome extension for multipurpose use.

## Features

- `Start Timer` and `Reset` buttons to control the functionality.



## Deployment

To deploy this extension: 

- Turn on developers option in chrome extension settings.
- Select `Load Unpacked` and then navigate to the source code directory.

## Issues to be resolved

These are some known issues that could be resolved in the future:

- [ ] UI glitch that can cause the `Set timer` screen to flash even when the timer is running.
- [ ] Automatic popup of the extension once the timer has completed running. (To be implemented)
- [ ] Sounds to be added to button press and timer completion for better UX.
- [ ] Better UI could be implemented, although the focus should be on ultra-minimalism.
